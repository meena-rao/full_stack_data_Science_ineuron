    "5. How much time will it take to train another Decision Tree on a training set of 10 million instances if it takes an hour to train a Decision Tree on a training set with 1 million instances? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "1. The estimated depth of a decision tree trained on a one million instance training set would depend on the complexity of the problem being solved and the degree of overfitting. It is difficult to estimate the exact depth without more information, but it is likely to be fairly deep, possibly in the range of 30-50 levels or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Gini impurity of a node is usually lower than that of its parent, but it is not always the case. The impurity can stay the same if the split does not improve the overall purity of the child nodes. However, in most cases, the impurity decreases because the split is chosen to maximize the information gain, which measures the reduction in impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Yes, reducing the max depth of a decision tree can be a good way to prevent overfitting. By limiting the depth, the tree becomes less complex and less likely to capture noise or outliers in the data. This can improve the generalization performance of the model and prevent it from overfitting the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scaling the input features can help a decision tree if it is underfitting the training set. Decision trees are not sensitive to the magnitude of the features, but they can be affected by differences in the scale of the features. Scaling the features to have similar ranges can help the tree split more effectively and capture more complex relationships between the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It is difficult to estimate the exact time required to train a decision tree on a training set of 10 million instances, but it is likely to take at least 10 times longer than training on a set with 1 million instances. If it takes an hour to train a decision tree on a training set with 1 million instances, it could take around 10 hours or more to train on a set with 10 million instances."
